"Props" refer to the properties being passed into a component in order for it to work correctly, similarly to how a function receives parameters:"from above"
A component receiving props is not allowed to modify those props.(i.e. they are "immutable.")

function addTwoNumbers(a, b) {
    a = 42 //In the body we can't just modify parameters even though when you run it it gives you 44 as against 3.
    return a + b //this is how a function receives parameters "from above".
}

addTwoNumbers(1, 2)

Simillarl in react
function Navbar(props) {
    props.coverImage = "something else" // this is a red flag because it should be immutable
}
Note that from within the body of your function you should never change your props.


"State" refers to values that are defined within the component, similar to variables defined inside a function.
Anytime you have changing values that should be saved/displayed, you will likely be using state.
